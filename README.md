## Project Overview

The game includes:

- A ball that bounces off the paddles and the top and bottom edges of the screen.
- A scoring system that awards a point to a player if the opponent fails to return the ball.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The game is entirely written in Python.
- Pygame: This Python library is used for game development.

## How to Run
